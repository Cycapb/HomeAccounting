There are planing, reports, todo lists, accounting itself. You can plan your purchases with OrderList and send them to an email in your profile. 
Site of the system http://homeacc.ddns.net
System is in russian but translation is in progress.

To start application locally you have to install MS SQL Server first. Then you need to rebuild solution using Debug.Local configuration. Debug.Local configuration uses database connection string with Data Source = localhost. After you start it first time all databases will be created.

If you can't connect to localhost then just read this article from stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12774827/cant-connect-to-localhost-on-sql-server-express-2012-2016 and follow the instructions. They're simple. Or if you're interested in developing this project you can write directly to me - aka.apostol@gmail.com.
